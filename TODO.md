# Solvers (test implementation/stability)
- [ ] Harmonic (add distance^q smoothing)
- [ ] Biharmonic
- [ ] Elasticity
- [ ] p-Laplacian*
- [ ] time*

# Domains (with mapping from reference)
- [ ] Square with cusp
- [ ] Circle with cusp (parametrized such that we recover smooth)
- [ ] Cake

# Networks (with reg loss, as autoencoder)
- [ ] FFFF
- [ ] CNN?
- [ ] ResNet

# Theory
- [ ] Conformal mappings - maybe use rational activation functions
- [ ] Circle <-> disc
- [ ] Convolution in a disk

# Visualization

determinant
with cross product
